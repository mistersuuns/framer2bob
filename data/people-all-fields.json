Building on some pioneering in the 70s and early 90s, I started the current phase of the Banded Mongoose Project in 1995 for my PhD , with the help of Francis Mwanguhya who is now the Field Manager. The project has grown in size and complexity over the years, not least because banded mongooses have turned out to be ideal for testing theories cooperation and conflict, early life influences on health and behaviour, and how the features of a society shape an animal’s life history. Our on how and why these patterns occur has contributed to a better understanding of the lives and behaviour of animals that live in families and groups",

    "description": "I have enjoyed seeing the project grow and develop over the years, and still enjoy seeing the mongooses every day. I particularly enjoy seeing new packs form in our population as I like the challenge of habituating wild individuals and comparing the behaviour of new packs with established ones. For this reason, I have a soft spot for Pack 19, a new pack on the peninsula, and am keen to get to know them as they become more habituated. I like reading novels and my favourite book is Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. I am also a keen sportsman and Manchester United fan. I have a wife, Edna, and four children: Sylvia, Evelyn, Shivan and Kelvin",
